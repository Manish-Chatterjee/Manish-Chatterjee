### About Me

_Passionate frontend developer and digital creator who loves building sleek, responsive, and SEO-friendly web interfaces. With a strong grip on **React**, and modern **JavaScript**, I craft user experiences that are both Performant and Elegant._

🔭 I’m currently diving deep into **full-stack development** with **MERN** and **Spring Boot**, aiming to land a **FAANG-level software engineering role**.  
🌇 My design style blends code and creativity — think city lights, glassmorphism, and night-inspired blur aesthetics.  
🎨 Outside of code, I'm a graphic illustrator and creative mind, always exploring ways to bring visual storytelling into my work.  
💡 Whether it's crafting a portfolio that *feels* like a product or optimizing load times down to the last millisecond, I believe in doing things with precision and passion.  
🚀 Always learning. Always building. Always evolving.
